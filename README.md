## üîé About <a name = "about"></a>

The whole point of this project is to showcase the concepts of SWE and DevOps that I have learned so far. This project features CI/CD workflows and automations, unittesting, and containerization. Git & Github were used as the VCS, and a Docker Hub image is published for container deployment. I dub this as "FizzBuzz-as-a-Service".

This program aims to create a FastAPI-based microservice that solves the classic FizzBuzz programming problem. The FizzBuzz problem is a common coding challenge often used in interviews to evaluate a candidate's basic programming skills. The task is to write a program that prints numbers from 1 to n; however, for multiples of 3, it should print "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of 5, it should print "Buzz," and for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, it should print "FizzBuzz". The FizzBuzz Microservice API provides a simple HTTP-based API to solve the FizzBuzz problem. It allows users to make requests to the microservice and receive the FizzBuzz sequence as a response. This microservice can be easily integrated into other applications or used for testing and learning purposes.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running the FizzBuzz Microservice API, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.8 or above
- pip package manager

### Installing

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jgfranco17/fizzbuzz-api.git
cd fizzbuzz-api
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

### Dev mode

To run the API server in dev mode, simply execute either of the following commands:

```bash
# Default Python execution
python app.py --port <PORT>

# Or, after editing the Makefile to set a port number
make run
```

### Build as Python module

To build the project as a Python module, run the following commands.

```bash
cd fizzbuzz-api
pip install .
```

Once the installation is completed, the package can be run as an independent CLI tool.

```bash
fizzbuzz-api -p <PORT>
```

### Build with Docker

To run the microservice in a container, the package comes with both a Dockerfile and a Compose YAML configuration. Run either of the following to get the API launched in a container; by default, the API will be set to listen on port 5050 for the Compose.

```bash
# Plain Docker build
docker build -t fizzbuzz-api .
docker run -p 5050:5050 fizzbuzz-api

# Docker-Compose build
docker-compose up
```

The Docker image is also available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jgfranco17/fizzbuzz-api)

```bash
docker pull jgfranco17/fizzbuzz-api:latest
```

## üåê Calling the API

Once the microservice is launched, the API is now reachable. To get a FizzBuzz sequence, simply send a `GET` request to the server, with the number as a parameter.

```bash
curl http://localhost:<PORT>/fizzbuzz?number=<number>
```
