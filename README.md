## üîé About <a name = "about"></a>

The whole point of this project is to showcase the concepts of SWE and DevOps that I have learned so far. This project features CI/CD workflows and automations, unittesting, and containerization. Git & Github were used as the VCS, and a Docker Hub image is published for container deployment. I dub this as "FizzBuzz-as-a-Service".

This program aims to create a FastAPI-based microservice that solves the classic FizzBuzz programming problem. The FizzBuzz problem is a common coding challenge often used in interviews to evaluate a candidate's basic programming skills. The task is to write a program that prints numbers from 1 to n; however, for multiples of 3, it should print "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of 5, it should print "Buzz," and for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, it should print "FizzBuzz". The FizzBuzz Microservice API provides a simple HTTP-based API to solve the FizzBuzz problem. It allows users to make requests to the microservice and receive the FizzBuzz sequence as a response. This microservice can be easily integrated into other applications or used for testing and learning purposes.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running the FizzBuzz Microservice API, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.8 or above
- pip package manager

### Installing

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jgfranco17/fizzbuzz-api.git
cd fizzbuzz-api
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

### Dev mode

To run the API server in dev mode, simply execute either of the following commands:

```bash
# Default Python execution
python app.py --port <PORT>

# Or, after editing the Makefile to set a port number
make run
```

### Build as Python module

To build the project as a Python module, run the following commands.

```bash
cd fizzbuzz-api
pip install .
```

Once the installation is completed, the package can be run as an independent CLI tool.

```bash
fizzbuzz-api -p <PORT>
```

### Build with Docker

To run the microservice in a container, the package comes with both a Dockerfile and a Compose YAML configuration. Run either of the following to get the API launched in a container; by default, the API will be set to listen on port 5050 for the Compose.

```bash
# Plain Docker build
docker build -t fizzbuzz-api .
docker run -p 5050:5050 fizzbuzz-api

# Docker-Compose build
docker compose up
```

The Docker image is also available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jgfranco17/fizzbuzz-api)

```bash
docker pull jgfranco17/fizzbuzz-api:latest
```

### Calling the API

Once the microservice is launched, the API is now reachable. To get a FizzBuzz sequence, simply send a `GET` request to the server, with the number as a parameter.

```bash
curl http://localhost:<PORT>/fizzbuzz?number=<number>
```

## üîß Testing <a name = "testing"></a>

### Running unittest suite

In order to run diagnostics and unittests, first install the testing dependencies. This will allow you to utilize the full capacity of the test modules we have built.

```bash
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

To run the full test suite, run the Justfile command as follows:

```bash
just pytest
```

### Using PyTest

You can run these tests using the [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.3.x/) CLI tool. To run all tests in the directory containing the test files, navigate to the directory and enter `pytest` in the command line; for added verbosity, add the `-vv` flag after. To run a specific test file, enter `pytest <filename>`.

```bash
# Run all tests in the testing module with verbose detail
pytest -vv

# Or, run a specific test file
cd ./tests
pytest -v <filename>.py
```

This will run the specified test module and generates a detailed result report in the terminal.

### Running Behave suite

Behave is a Python-based BDD framework that allows you to write tests in a natural language style using Gherkin syntax. Gherkin uses a simple, human-readable format that is easy for both technical and non-technical stakeholders to understand. Behave translates these plain-text scenarios into executable code, allowing teams to collaborate on defining and implementing software features.

To run the full Behave suite, run the Justfile command as follows:

```bash
just behave
```

This will run the specified test module and generates a detailed result report in the terminal.

#### Why BDD?

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a software development methodology that focuses on collaboration among developers, QA, and non-technical stakeholders. BDD aims to enhance communication and understanding by using natural language descriptions of software behaviors and features. BDD allows teams to define the expected behavior of the software before implementation; clear specifications help developers focus on delivering features that meet business requirements. Non-technical team members can also easily understand and contribute to the specification process.

For example, below is a demonstration of a simple test case for pinging the `/healthz` endpoint.

```gherkin
Scenario: Access health-check endpoint
    Given I start the API
    When I send a request to "/healthz"
    Then the response is returned with status code 200
```

Using Gherkin allows us to run simple test cases without diving too deep into the technicals. As long as the test-writer is
familiarized with the basic test steps that can be used, there is no need to use more complex testing frameworks for routine
tests. Feel free to write your own Gherkin steps for this project!

### Load-testing with Locust

Load testing is a type of performance testing that evaluates how a system behaves under a specific load. The primary goal is to ensure the
system can handle expected user traffic and identify potential bottlenecks or performance issues before they affect end users. During load
testing, the system is subjected to increasing numbers of simultaneous users or transactions to determine its capacity, stability, and
scalability.

For this project, we use [Locust](https://locust.io/), an open-source load testing tool that is highly flexible and scalable, making it a
popular choice for load testing web applications, APIs, and other services.
